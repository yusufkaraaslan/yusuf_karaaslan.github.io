Abramsky</h2>\r\n  <p>RS, FRSE is a computer scientist who currently holds the Christopher Strachey Professorship at Oxford University Computing Laboratory. He is well known for playing a leading role in the development of game semantics. He has made significant contributions to the areas of domain theory, the lazy lambda calculus, strictness analysis, concurrency theory, interaction categories, and the geometry of interaction.</p>\r\n  <img src=\"C:\\Users\\yusuf\\Desktop\\yy.jpg\" alt=\"C:\\Users\\yusuf\\Desktop\\yy.jpg\" >\r\n  <h2>Biography</h2>\r\n  <p>Since the Year 2000, he has been a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, a Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford and Christopher Strachey Professor of Computing at Oxford University Computing Laboratory. He has also been a Fellow of the Royal Society since 2004. His research achievements include the development of game semantics, domain theory in logical form, and categorical quantum mechanics.\r\n\r\n  He was educated at Hasmonean Grammar School for Boys, Hendon and at King's College, Cambridge (BA 1975, MA Philosophy 1979, Diploma in Computer Science) and Queen Mary, University of London (PhD Computer Science 1988, supervised by Richard Bornat)</p>\r\n  <h2>Research career</h2>\r\n  <p>Samson Abramsky is Christopher Strachey Professor of Computing and a Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford University. Previously he held chairs at the Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, and at the University of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n  He holds MA degrees from Cambridge and Oxford, and a PhD from the University of London.\r\n\r\n  He is a Fellow of the Royal Society (2004), a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (2000), and a Member of Academia Europaea (1993). He is a member of the Editorial Boards of the North Holland Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics, and of the Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science. He was General Chair of LiCS 2000-2003, and is currently a member of the LiCS Organizing Committee.\r\n\r\n  He has played a leading role in the development of game semantics, and its applications to the semantics of programming languages. Other notable contributions include his work on domain theory in logical form, the lazy lambda calculus, strictness analysis, concurrency theory, interaction categories, and geometry of interaction. He has recently been working on high-level methods for quantum computation and information.</p>\r\n  \r\n  </body>\r\n</html>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
